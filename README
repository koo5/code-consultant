well a big thank you to nathan for making this public, heres the mess i made of it trying to make it work as an irc bot for diaspora's shapado

the actual ircizing was done with bitlbee and irssi, triggers are attached.

I think it doesnt understand the time entry correctly, 
it falls into an endless fetching loop yet doesnt fetch all questions.

also added an incomplete build.xml (or how do you do it, nathan?)

and changed sensitivity so it would respond to simple keywords too.

bump to sdk 1.3.7.
