an attempt to make it work with shapado.
I think it doesnt understand the time entry correctly, 
it falls into an endless fetching loop yet doesnt fetch all questions.

also added an incomplete build.xml (or how do you do it, nathan?)

and changed sensitivity so it would respond to simple keywords too.

bump to sdk 1.3.7.
